Here are the necessary import statements:

```java
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.annotations.XStreamAlias;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.converters.Converter;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.io.HierarchicalStreamReader;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.io.HierarchicalStreamWriter;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.security.AnyTypePermission;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.security.NoTypePermission;
```

However, the following imports are not necessary in this code snippet:

```java
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.security.AnyTypePermission;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.security.NoTypePermission;
```

So the final import statements should be:

```java
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.annotations.XStreamAlias;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.converters.Converter;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.io.HierarchicalStreamReader;
import com.thoughtworks.xstream.io.HierarchicalStreamWriter;
```
